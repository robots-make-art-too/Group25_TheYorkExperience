Artist STATEMENT/Introduction: 

For this assignment we wanted to integrate the scenery of York University’s campus by using it as the main setting to display our content. However, we wanted to put our own spin on things by changing the entire portrayal of the university itself. We currently live in a society of constant and ongoing change where new innovations are a common occurrence. Technology is the main component that provides a large number of innovators around the globe with a platform to build and share their work with the world. Due to this ongoing change, we wanted to portray York University's campus as if it were in the future. In recent times, we have seen many depictions of the future of the world through films, TV series, novels, media etc. We have even witnessed this in reality through famous innovators including, Elon Musk, who allow us to use our imagination and consider what the future beholds. In this case, we used Denis Villeneuve’s “Blade Runner 2049” , a dystopian and futuristic portrayal of the future, as our main inspiration for our content. The markers that were built give a little hint as to what exactly will appear when they are scanned. Three different models that all relate to our dystopian theme appear when scanned by the user. The three models include a hover car, robot and spaceship, and these very well could end up being common innovations of the future. Before clicking our link below to display the content, please glance through the instructions. We hope you enjoy the futuristic York experience!


Instructions: 

As seen in the video below, the content is displayed at two of York University's locations, Vari Hall and the subway station. Vari Hall was chosen mainly due to the actual architecture of the building itself, it just gives off a futuristic essence when standing in front of it. The subway station was chosen because this can be considered the hub of transportation at the university and since two of our models can be used as methods of transportation, this site was chosen. 

Although our content can be displayed practically anywhere if you have the markers for each model, we want you to experience the models in the same way we did in order to obtain the full experience. Therefore like the video below shows, walk to each of these locations and place the markers in front of them. Due to the actual daylight, you may need to position the marker in a certain way in order to get the model to show up and avoid any glare. At vari hall, use the robot marker to display the robot model. At the subway station, use the spaceship and hovercar markers to display each of these given models. Use different angles and vantage points around each location in order to view each model from a different perspective. Now that you have glanced through everything, click the link below the video to run and display our content!
