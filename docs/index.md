Backstory/Introduction: 

For this assignment we wanted to integrate the scenery of York University's campus by using it as the main setting to display our content. However, we wanted to put our own spin on things by changing the entire portrayal of the university itself. We currently live in a society of constant and ongoing change where new innovations are a common occurence. Technology is the main component that provides a large amount of innovators around the globe with a platform to build and share their work with the world. Due to this ongoing change, we wanted to portray York Univeristy's campus as if it were in the future. In recent times, we have seen many depictions of the future of the world through films, TV series, novels, media etc. We have even witnessed this in reality through famous innovators including, Elon Musk, who allow us to use our imagination and consider what the future beholds. In this case, we used Denis Villeneuve's "Blade Runner 2049" a dystopian and futuristic portrayl of the future, as our main inspiration for our content. The markers that were built give a little hint as to what exactly will appear when they are scanned. Three different models that all relate to our dystopian theme appear when scanned by the user. The three models include a hovercar, robot and spaceship, and these very well could end up being common innovations of the future. Before clicking our link below to display the content, please glance through the instructions. We hope you enjoy the futurisitic York experience!
